## About

GeoQuery will be an app that maps existing, open data, in combination with user provided data. In turn, these datasets and visualizations can be used to inform citizens and government officials so that they can make informed decisions.  For example, it may be used to determine where grocery stores and community farms should be incentivized to reduce food deserts.

## Development

GeoQuery is actively under development.  Feel free to clone a copy, make mods, and send in pull requests.
